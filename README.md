# Maddie-s-Chamber
I’m an artist who thrives on raw emotion whether it’s through my artwork or the Midwest emo music I love. When I’m not creating, you’ll find me at underground gigs, where the energy and authenticity fuel my passion. I also play in a band, and performing live gives me the same cathartic release as creating art.
